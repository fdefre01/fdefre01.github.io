	<h1>Biography</h1>
	<hr/>
	<p>I'm currently an undergraduate studying biology and computer science at Tufts University in Medford, MA. Originially from San Francisco, I was born into a rich culture of technology and science which has led to an appreciation of the intersection between computers and biology. As a pre-med student, I'm also passionate about how we can better use technology to address today's most pressing issues in health and medicine. In the future, I hope to practice medicine as well as participate in academic research to address these issues and hopefully make a big impact in the field by doing so.</p>
