This assignment implementation basic use of both HTML and CSS to create a personal portfolio with three pages:
index.html-- this contains my name, a picture of me, as well as links to the following two pages
bio.html-- this contains a brief biography 
resume.html-- this contains all parts of my resume including name, professional experience, activities, and skillset

This project also involved using git and Github to track its changes and progress. All of the above have been implemented
correctly. There are three CSS files, one for each page, each of which contain at least 5 rules. All files were run through
CSS and HTML validation for their respective types and no errors were found. 

I worked a total of about 7-10 hours on the assignment, and tried to create a page that reflected mature style to go along 
with the content it showed. Though Kensey Olsen and I did not work together, we were each others answer-men for generic command
line questions and questions regarding correct git/Github use. No code was shared between us, but we did show off our final 
results to each other.
